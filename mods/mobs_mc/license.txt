Original "Slimes Redone" README follows

"Slimes Redone" - Mod for Minetest (http://www.minetest.net/)

Introduction
==========================================================================================================================
This mod adds two type of mobs in the world of Minetest: green slimes and lava slimes. They are hostile and will attack the
players as soon as they see them. If they are defeated, the slimes maybe will reward the player with useful resources.

Green slimes live in the tall grass of the jungles and in the ancient ruins of lost temples. And lava slimes live deep 
underground near the lava pools.

I've made this mod inspired by this other: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=2979&hilit=slimes which adds friendly
slimes. Thank you Jeija!

Details
==========================================================================================================================
- Adds two new hostile mobs: green slimes and lava slimes.
- They attack players and hurt them on touch. (i'm not sure if the amount of damage is enough or too much...:/)
- The biger ones split in a random amout of smaller versions when defeated: big > medium > small.
- They can get different enviromental damage: water, lava, sunlight and falling.
- They use custom textures and sounds. (more work needs to be done here ;P)
- Cartoonish animation (they deform a bit when landing and stretch out when jumping).
- Effects (blood, smoke, bubbles, footprints,..).
- API to add new slimes.

Green slimes:
  > spawn in jungle grass or in temples mossy cobble (default:mossycobble).
  > on die, they drop a randomish amount of glue (from mesecon mod)
  > Lava hurts them.

Lava slimes:
  > spawn in lava pools deep under ground.
  > on die, they drop a randomish amount of gunpowder (from default tnt mod).
  > water hurts them.
  > when they jump they leave behind a footprint of fire. ^^
