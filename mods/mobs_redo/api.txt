mobs:register_spawn(name, nodes, max_light, min_light, chance, active_object_count, max_height, day_toggle)

mobs:spawn_specfic(name, nodes, neighbors, min_light, max_light, interval, chance, active_object_count, min_height, max_height, day_toggle)

These functions register a spawn algorithm for the mob. Without this function the call the mobs won't spawn.

    'name' is the name of the animal/monster
    'nodes' is a list of nodenames on that the animal/monster can spawn on top of
    'neighbors' is a list of nodenames on that the animal/monster will spawn beside (default is {"air"} for mobs:register_spawn)
    'max_light' is the maximum of light
    'min_light' is the minimum of light
    'interval' is same as in register_abm() (default is 30 for mobs:register_spawn)
    'chance' is same as in register_abm()
    'active_object_count' mob is only spawned if active_object_count_wider of ABM is <= this
    'min_height' is the maximum height the mob can spawn
    'max_height' is the maximum height the mob can spawn
    'day_toggle' true for day spawning, false for night or nil for anytime


Players can override the spawn chance for each mob registered by adding a line to their minetest.conf file with a new value, the lower the value the more each mob will spawn e.g.

mobs_animal:sheep_chance 11000 or mobs_monster:sand_monster_chance 100

For each mob that spawns with this function is a field in mobs.spawning_mobs. It tells if the mob should spawn or not. Default is true. So other mods can only use the API of this mod by disabling the spawning of the default mobs in this mod.
