Makes the head, and the right arm when you’re mining, face the way you’re facing, similar to Minecraft. Compatible with 3d_armor. Forked from the animplus mod, which was an ugly hack.

The head only turns up and down relative to the body, except it turns slightly to the right/left when you strafe right/left. When you turn the body turns with the head.

Works in multiplayer, I tested it on a local server.
